# STATS220

## About this repo

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Science, specialising in Data Science and majoring in Statistics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I'm doing Data Science, as it's essential for my major.
- I am interested in learning about R Language since its a quite important tool in this course.


My Future Goals:

1. Get better at using R for data analysis.
2. Complete the project on time, by starting it earlier!
